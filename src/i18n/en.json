            "It's hard to change your mind with your mind — it's easier to change your mind with the body. This is where the power of breath comes in…  in the moment with immediate influence on your nervous system and brain. <br>",
            "Breathe in. Breathe out. <br>",
            "We don't think too much about the breathing process, but your breath can tell you a lot about your body. <br>",
            "Breathwork is a holistic, mind-body approach to mental health and well-being. It can be done simply and on your own, or it can be structured and part of a formal program. Its purpose is to directly influence your body's inner workings to reduce stress, anxiety, and other challenges, increase calm, and encourage well-being. <br><br>",
            "In this specific breathwork, we are “not teaching” the body how to breathe; we are just “reminding” how it used to breathe until it was 3 years old. We all breathe all the time! The way we breathe is what makes a difference. For example: when we are stressed, our breathing speeds up and becomes shallow which triggers fight- a fight-flight-freeze response, and when we are in this state, we are not digesting food or our emotions properly. <br><br>",
            "Our mind is scattered, however, when we are relaxed and the mind is calmer, our breathing is deep and rhythmic. That influences the entire body, especially the rest and digest system which reverses the stress response, allowing the body to relax so we switch our system from a state of stress to a state of calm. <br><br>",
            "Once you notice the power of your breath, I promise you will also see the full potential of Yourself."
